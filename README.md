# **Bike Service Demand Analysis**
This project aims to analyze and understand the factors that significantly influence the demand for shared electric cycles in the Indian market. The analysis involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Hypothesis Testing on the provided dataset to identify key features that predict cycle demand.

# Project Overview
In this project, we:

Analyze the dataset to explore the relationships between different features and the target variable (bike rental count).
Perform Hypothesis Testing to identify significant features impacting the demand.
Visualize the data and key insights using various plotting techniques.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis contains the following features:

datetime: Timestamp of the entry.

season: Season of the year (1: spring, 2: summer, 3: fall, 4: winter).

holiday: Indicator if the day is a holiday.

workingday: Indicator if the day is a working day (not a weekend or holiday).

weather: Weather condition coded into four categories.

temp: Temperature in Celsius.

atemp: Feels-like temperature in Celsius.

humidity: Humidity percentage.

windspeed: Wind speed.

casual: Count of casual users.

registered: Count of registered users.

count: Total count of rental bikes (Target).

## Skills and Tools Used

Python: The primary programming language used for the analysis.

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

NumPy: For numerical computations.

Seaborn & Matplotlib: For data visualization.

Hypothesis Testing: To determine the statistical significance of the features.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): To discover patterns and insights in the dataset.
